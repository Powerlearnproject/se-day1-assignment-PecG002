Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
it's the process of designing, developing, and maintaining software
it enables the systematic development of  maintainable and reliable software systems


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The software crisis(1960s) this period exposed the inefficiencies of informal programming, causing project failures and leading to the formalization of software engineering
The rise of structured programming (1970s) introduced modularity and structured design replacing chaotic code with maintainable, well-organised programming practices
object-oriented programming revolution(1980s-1990s) transformed software development with concepts like encapsulation and inheritance, enabling reusable and scalable code


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning- Defines project scope, goals, risks and resource allocation
requirement analysis- Gathers and documents functional and non-functional requirements
design-creates system architecture, UI, design, and database models
implementation(coding)- developers write and integrate the actual software code
testing- identifies and fixes defects through various testing methods
deployment- releases the software for use either in stages or fully
maintenance- provides updates, bug fixes and enhancements after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
regarding approach, waterfall uses linear and sequential while agile uses iterative and incremental
regarding flexibility, waterfall is rigid, with defined phases while  agile is highly adaptable to changes
appropriate scenarios:
waterfALL:- government or aerospace projects where requirements are clear from the start and strict documentation is necessary
Agile:-software startups or mobile app development where customer needs evolve rapidly, requiring continuous updates


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer- writes, tests, and maintains code based on project requirements ensuring functionality, performance and security of the software
quality assurance engineer- designs and executes test cases, identifies bugs and ensures the software meets quality standards before deployment.
project manager- oversees planning, coordination and execution of the project, ensuring timelines, budgets and team collaboration align with business goals

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs streamline software development by providing tools like code editors, debuggers and compilers in a single interface, enhancing productivity and reducing errors
e.g visual studio code(lightweight and extensible), intelliJ IDEA( optimised for java development)
VCS allows developers to track changes, collaborate efficiently, and reverts to previous versions if needed preventing data loss and code conflicts
e.g Git, Apache subvesrion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
debugging and fixing bugs- use debugging tools, write clean code, and conduct a thorough testing
keeping up with technology- continuos upskilling through courses, tech blogs, and developer communities.
work-life balance- set boundaries, take breaks and manage time effectively

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing – Tests individual components or functions in isolation. Helps catch bugs early, simplifies debugging, and improves code quality.  
Integration Testing – Ensures multiple components work together. Detects API, database, or module interaction issues.  
System Testing – Evaluates the entire software to ensure full functionality, performance, and security. Validates real-world behavior.  
Acceptance Testing – Confirms the software meets business requirements. Ensures user satisfaction before release.  



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It's the art of giving Ai effective questions or statements, structuring them in a way that improves accuracy.
it's important as it enables one to achieve clarity and specificity

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
i need an image of a girl
improved- i need an image of a black girl with braided hair in a formal attire

yes the first one would have given me an image of a girl but the last one gave me the kind of girl i wanted by that i mean it's very clear and to the point
